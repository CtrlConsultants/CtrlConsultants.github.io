            <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

            <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

            <p>In John#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

            <h5>About Joe</h5>

            <h5>Teaching Our CSS to Play Nice</h5>

            <p>Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does our CSS. Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn&#8217;t always play nice with others. We need to learn how to manage and optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. If we start early, we can use best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any designer or developer would be happy to work with.</p>

            <h5>About Jen</h5>

            <p>Jen Myers is a web designer/developer and part of the instructor team at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. In 2011, she founded the Columbus, Ohio chapter of Girl Develop It, an organization that provides introductory coding classes aimed at women, and she currently co-leads the Girl Develop It Chicago chapter. She speaks regularly about design, development and diversity, and focuses on finding new ways to make both technology and technology education accessible to everyone.</p>

            <p>Creating in the face of negativity, fear, health problems, and your inner critic can at times feel impossible. Let&#8217;s face our fears together, name these problems and break them down, silence our inner critics, and talk about when it&#8217;s time to take a break or let go of a project for good.</p>

            <h5>About Jenn</h5>

            <h5>What Designers Can Learn from Parenting</h5>

            <p>That first client meeting may not feel as warm and fulfilling as the first time you hold your newborn child, but consider the similarities.</p>

            <p>You know each other but have never met. As the relationship grows you will have to rely on your experiences and education to gently guide them while allowing flexibility for projects to change and evolve. It&#8217;s not your job to control everything, but if you are successful you will create a well-rounded piece that everyone involved can love.</p>

            <h5>About Jennifer</h5>

            <p>Jennifer Jones is an event coordinator for the WebVisions Conference and also co-authors a blog with her teenage daughter. She and her family live in Portland, Oregon where she balances work, parenting and any other life challenge with honesty, humor and liquor.</p>

            <h5>Leveling Up with Flexbox</h5>

            <p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of &#8220;flexbox,&#8221; short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3&#8217;s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we&#8217;ve dealt with for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8217;ve probably relegated flexbox to the &#8220;one day&#8221; pile of web design tricks.</p>

            <p>It&#8217;s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it&#8217;s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today. You&#8217;ll learn how to take your designs—and web design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>

            <h5>About Zoe</h5>
